# üéµ Fix: User Token Sync Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
User was logged in successfully with Spotify OAuth, but the app was still trying to use "guest mode" and showing:
```
üéµ [SPOTIFY] Getting access token for guest mode...
‚ö†Ô∏è [SPOTIFY] Client credentials not available on web - user authentication required
```

Even though the user was authenticated!

## Root Cause
The `SpotifyAuthService` was successfully authenticating users and storing the access token, but it **never passed the token** to the `SpotifyService`. 

The two services were operating independently:
- ‚úÖ `SpotifyAuthService` had the user's access token
- ‚ùå `SpotifyService` didn't know about it
- ‚ùå `SpotifyService._getValidToken()` couldn't find `_userAccessToken` (always null)
- ‚ùå Fell back to guest mode (which doesn't work on web)

## Solution
Changed `SpotifyService` from a standalone `ChangeNotifierProvider` to a `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` that listens to `SpotifyAuthService`:

**Before:**
```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => SpotifyService()),
```

**After:**
```dart
ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<SpotifyAuthService, SpotifyService>(
  create: (_) => SpotifyService(),
  update: (context, auth, spotify) {
    // Sync user access token from auth service to spotify service
    if (auth.isAuthenticated && auth.accessToken != null) {
      spotify?.setUserAccessToken(auth.accessToken!);
    }
    return spotify!;
  },
),
```

## How It Works Now

1. User logs in ‚Üí `SpotifyAuthService` gets access token
2. `SpotifyAuthService` notifies listeners (state change)
3. `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` detects the change
4. Calls `update()` which syncs token to `SpotifyService`
5. `SpotifyService.setUserAccessToken()` is called automatically
6. Now `_getValidToken()` finds the user token ‚úÖ
7. Uses user token instead of trying guest mode ‚úÖ

## Expected Console Output (After Fix)

When logged in, you should see:
```
‚úÖ [AUTH] Login successful!
‚úÖ [AUTH] User: ByFlowyx
üéµ [SPOTIFY] Using user access token  ‚Üê This is the key message!
```

Instead of the old error:
```
üéµ [SPOTIFY] Getting access token for guest mode...
‚ö†Ô∏è [SPOTIFY] Client credentials not available on web
```

## Testing

1. Go to: https://byflowt.github.io/spotify-ai-music-app/
2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (important!)
3. Login with Spotify
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Try to search or use any Spotify feature
6. You should see: `üéµ [SPOTIFY] Using user access token`

## Files Changed
- `lib/main.dart` - Updated provider configuration

## Git Commit
- Commit 398a12f: "Fix: Sync user access token from auth service to spotify service automatically"

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - User tokens now sync automatically between services!

**Note:** You still need to add the Spotify environment variables to Vercel for the backend proxy to work (see SPOTIFY_TOKEN_PROXY_SETUP.md).
