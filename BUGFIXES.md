# Bug Fixes - Session 2

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **Recommendations API 404 Error**
**Problem**: API calls failing with 404 error showing `seed_genres=frenchcore:1`
- The `:1` suffix was being added somewhere in the URL encoding
- Special characters in genre names caused issues

**Solution**:
- Added genre cleaning in `spotify_service.dart`
- Strips non-alphanumeric characters (except hyphens)
- Converts to lowercase
- Added debug logging to track the actual URL

**Code Changes** (`lib/services/spotify_service.dart`):
```dart
if (seedGenres != null && seedGenres.isNotEmpty) {
  // Clean genre names - remove special characters
  final cleanGenres = seedGenres
      .take(1)
      .map((g) => g.toLowerCase().replaceAll(RegExp(r'[^a-z0-9-]'), ''))
      .where((g) => g.isNotEmpty)
      .toList();
  if (cleanGenres.isNotEmpty) {
    params['seed_genres'] = cleanGenres.join(',');
  }
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ **Artist Top Tracks Not Loading**
**Problem**: Dr. Peacock and other artists showing "0 Tracks" even though they have tracks

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Some artists' tracks aren't available in all markets
- Previous code was too strict - if no previews found, might return empty
- Needed to try more markets and be less strict about previews

**Solution**:
- Added Netherlands (NL) to market list (7 markets now instead of 5)
- Changed logic to keep tracks even if no previews available
- Added try-catch per market to handle failures gracefully
- Improved logging to debug which markets work
- Now returns ANY tracks found, prioritizing those with previews

**Code Changes** (`lib/services/spotify_service.dart`):
```dart
// Added NL market
final markets = ['US', 'GB', 'CA', 'AU', 'DE', 'FR', 'ES', 'SE', 'BR', 'MX', 'NL'];

// Try more markets (7 instead of 5)
for (var market in markets.take(7)) {
  try {
    // ... API call ...
    
    // Keep tracks even if no previews
    if (tracks.isNotEmpty && (tracks.length > bestTracks.length || previewCount > maxPreviewCount)) {
      maxPreviewCount = previewCount;
      bestTracks = tracks;
    }
  } catch (marketError) {
    // Continue to next market instead of failing
  }
}
```

**Added Error Handling** (`lib/screens/artist_detail_page.dart`):
- Wrapped `_loadTopTracks()` in try-catch
- Added console logging for debugging
- Prevents crashes if API fails

### 3. ‚úÖ **AI Playlist Not Showing in "My List"**
**Status**: Already implemented correctly!

The `saveGeneratedPlaylist()` method in `ai_playlist_service.dart` correctly adds tracks to PlaylistManager:

```dart
Future<void> saveGeneratedPlaylist() async {
  for (var track in _generatedTracks) {
    await _playlistManager.addTrack(track);
  }
}
```

**How it works**:
1. Generate AI playlist
2. Click "Save to My List" button
3. Tracks are added to PlaylistManager
4. Navigate to "My List" tab to see them
5. Badge shows count on nav bar

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Logout Functionality**
**Problem**: No way to logout once logged in

**Solution**: Added logout button to homepage

**Implementation** (`lib/screens/home_page.dart`):
- Added AppBar with logout icon button
- Only visible when user is authenticated
- Shows confirmation dialog before logout
- Uses Material 3 styling

**Features**:
- üö™ Logout icon in top-right corner
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirmation dialog prevents accidental logouts
- üé® Material 3 design with FilledButton
- ‚ú® Smooth transition back to login screen

**Code**:
```dart
appBar: isAuthenticated ? AppBar(
  backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
  elevation: 0,
  actions: [
    IconButton(
      onPressed: () async {
        final confirm = await showDialog<bool>(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: const Text('Logout'),
            content: const Text('Are you sure you want to logout?'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, false),
                child: const Text('Cancel'),
              ),
              FilledButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, true),
                child: const Text('Logout'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
        if (confirm == true && context.mounted) {
          await authService.logout();
        }
      },
      icon: const Icon(Icons.logout_rounded),
      tooltip: 'Logout',
    ),
  ],
) : null,
```

## üîç Debugging Improvements

### Enhanced Logging
Added console logging throughout:

1. **Recommendations API** (`spotify_service.dart`):
   ```dart
   if (kDebugMode) {
     print('Recommendations URL: $uri');
   }
   ```

2. **Artist Top Tracks** (`spotify_service.dart`):
   ```dart
   print('Artist $artistId - Market $market: $previewCount/${tracks.length} tracks');
   print('Final result for artist $artistId: ${bestTracks.length} tracks');
   ```

3. **Artist Detail Page** (`artist_detail_page.dart`):
   ```dart
   print('Error loading top tracks for ${widget.artist.name}: $e');
   ```

### Better Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all API calls
- Graceful fallbacks when markets fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Prevents app crashes
