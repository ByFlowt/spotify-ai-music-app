# Material 3 Expressive Design Overhaul - Summary

## 🎨 Design Improvements

### 1. **Material 3 Expressive Design**
- Implemented throughout the app with rounded corners (28px border radius)
- Enhanced elevation and shadows for depth
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

### 2. **Animations & Transitions**
Created new animation utilities (`lib/utils/animations.dart`):
- **SlideInAnimation**: Smooth entry animations with fade
- **ScaleInAnimation**: Pop-in effect with bounce
- **PulseAnimation**: Subtle breathing animation for focal elements

### 3. **Loading States**
