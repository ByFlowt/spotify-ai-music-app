## 📝 Important Notes

⚠️ **Do NOT commit `.env`** - It contains your secret API keys  
⚠️ **Each developer needs their own `.env`** - Copy from `.env.example`  
⚠️ **Never expose Client Secret** - Keep it only in backend/secure storage  
⚠️ **Use different keys** - Separate dev/prod API keys if possible  
⚠️ **Monitor API usage** - Some services have rate limits

### Troubleshooting

**"API Key not found"** → Check `.env` file exists with your keys  
**"Login fails"** → Verify Spotify Client ID & Secret in `.env`  
**"AI playlist doesn't work"** → Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set  
**"Audio recognition not working"** → Set AUDD_API_KEY in `.env`
